# predict-mpg

Description:
The dataset is technical spec of cars. The aim is to predict mpg (miles per gallon). The feature description is given as follows:
• mpg (miles per gallon): continuous<br>
• cylinders: multi-valued discrete<br>
• displacement: continuous<br>
• horsepower: continuous<br>
• weight: continuous<br>
• acceleration: continuous<br>
• model year: multi-valued discrete<br>
• origin: multi-valued discrete<br>
• car name: string (unique for each instance)
<br><br>
1. Perform feature selection on the dataset using either filter method or wrapper method.
2. Build a single predictive model using Support Vector Machine algorithm.
